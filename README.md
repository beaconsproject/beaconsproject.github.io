## Welcome to the BEACONs Project

The [BEACONs Project](https://beaconsproject.ualberta.ca/) was founded at the University of Alberta in recognition for a new approach to conservation planning in North America's boreal region. We are building a credible scientific framework for comprehensive conservation planning through the development and application of leading-edge conservation science that includes consideration of both protected areas and lands managed for other values. The premise of our research is that the ultimate goal of conservation is to identify human activities that are compatible with the maintenance of biological diversity and integrity of ecological systems. The conceptual scientific framework guiding our research is the Conservation Matrix Model. On this site we develop and maintain documentation, packages, apps, and code to support various conservation related projects:
* R packages to assist in large scale conservation planning.
* Various R/Shiny apps that assist in survey design, footprint/intactness mapping, etc.
* Google Earth Engine code and apps to support disturbance mapping.
* Documentation to support disturbance mapping and connectivity analyses.
